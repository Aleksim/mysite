The text is still valid eventhough nowadays I tend to have little bit more pragmatic (less idealistic) approach to the job. Growth team doesn't solve all problems, growth team tries to fulfill the potential of the existing product/service.

Our journey started when we got Tempo-funding for our pointNG innovation. However, we realized quickly that in order to make pointNG produce money we would need to do A LOT of technical development and even still the product market fit was highly questionable and depended on e.g. how privacy law would develop in the future. However, we had time on our hands and a great team so we started hustling. Eventually, we ended up creating <span><a href="https://www.pointNG.io">pointNG</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.consolechat.io">Consolechat </a></span>(trending in front page of Hackernews for 12 hours and 6500 users in first 24h), <span><a href="https://www.hacker-ai.io">Hacker AI </a></span> (260 upvotes and #3 Product of the Day), <span><a href="https://www.growthhackertools.io">Growthhackertools </a></span>(my quick side hustle), <span><a href="https://www.grew.ai">Grew.ai </a></span> (a generic email subject line prediction tool), <span><a href="https://www.grewai.com">GrewAI </a></span>(our first GPT-3 application with Mailchimp integration) and last but not least <span><a href="https://www.grewai.com">Superlines </a></span> (A GPT-3 application). Before this project I had never built web crawlers, created animations, launched in product hunt, trended in Hackernews, created cap tables and financial projections, applied for patents in US and EU and so on.. Learned amazingly much in 7 months.

                                <span className="year">Selaamo 2018-2019</span>: Selaamo was a big challenge from growth and leadership perspective: how to build a complex, two sided platform with physical dimensions, with no money and no full-time employees. Throughout the project my main focus was to figure out how we can make Selaamo a success while not burning anyone out or losing friendships. Our plans worked really well and we managed to get over 4000 users to the platform in the first few months and lots of sales happening on the platform. Things started to go downhill as we couldn't keep growing the user base quickly enough. This was due to 1) no VC was interested in funding book recycling 2) no money to set up customer acquisition programs 3) Team started to get weary after 1 year of working on weekends and after work. Learned a lot, especially about leadership.

WhisprApp was exactly like the now famous 'Jodel' application. I did not know any developers at that time but luckily met the cool guys: Timo and Larisa in one hackathon. We eventually built the service for Windows Phone 8 and had some excited users in the university. We participated in the Summer of start-ups arranged by Boost Turku. Every start up coach hated our idea and wanted to change it ðŸ˜‚. Learned valuable lessons with the whole experience.
