                                    I have set-up/ran formal 'growth teams' in four different organisations and participated in sparring about the topic in many other organisations since 2017. My growth teams have followed the "Sean Ellis" playbook where the focus has been on <span className='teamwork-emphasis'>fast tempo testing across the whole customer journey by a cross-competence team</span>. I wrote <span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-run-growth-team-aleksi-immonen/">this blog post</a></span> about the topic, as a young and excited consultant, in the early 2018. The text is still somewhat valid eventhough nowadays I tend to have a little bit more pragmatic approach to the job. Growth team doesn't solve all problems, growth teams can be organised in many different ways - <span className='teamwork-emphasis'>growth team tries to fullfill the potential of the existing product/service.</span> Sometimes this aspiration can lead to extraordinary creativity.

Throughout the project my main focus was to figure out how we can make Selaamo a success while not burning anyone out or losing friendships. Our plans worked really well and we managed to get over 4000 users to the platform in the first few months and lots of sales happening on the platform. Things started to go downhill as we couldn't keep growing the user base quickly enough. This was due to 1) no VC was interested in funding book recycling 2) no money to set up customer acquisition programs 3) Team started to get weary after 1 year of working on weekends and after work. Learned a lot, especially about leadership.

WhisprApp was exactly like the now famous 'Jodel' application. I did not know any developers at that time but luckily met the cool guys: Timo and Larisa in one hackathon. We eventually built the service for Windows Phone 8 and had some excited users in the university. We participated in the Summer of start-ups arranged by Boost Turku. Every start up coach hated our idea and wanted to change it ðŸ˜‚. Learned valuable lessons with the whole experience.
