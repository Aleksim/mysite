  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>Being average sucks.</span> Especially
  when you try to learn something hard.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Average people can't just intuitively make sense of complex systems or
  patterns. Or somehow remember some weird new concepts after the first time
  they learn about them.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  For us, there is just the long and hard road from not understanding anything,
  to understanding, step by step, little bit more. Every step on this road
  requires effort.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  For the last few years I've found myself from this road multiple times and I
  think I've learnt something about the learning-hard-things itself.

<h2 className="blog-h2">Definition of a hard thing</h2>

<p className="text-b">Okay so what is a hard thing?</p>

<p className="text-b">My definition of a hard thing is:</p>

```js
const hardThing = () => {
  return "thing that a human has close to zero percent natural ability to understand or execute effectively."
}
```

<h2 className="blog-h2">My top three hard things</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  The top three "hard things" that I have suffered with (ranked by the intensity
  of suffering) are probably:
</p>

<div className="list-element">
  <ul className="list-b">
    <li>#1 Coding,</li>
    <li>#2 Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu,</li>
    <li>#3 Surfing</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p className="text-b">
  Each hard in their own ways, but also similar in their hardness.
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">Few tips for learning hard things:</h2>

    #1 When the frustration is highest, you are often closest to the solution.
  </span>{" "}
  One of the most annoying things about learning hard things is that the
  learning can be very painful. It is hard to see the value in being stuck to
  some detail for the 100th hour. But when you are stuck and think that you are
  not learning anything, you are actually learning the most. In that moment, you
  are{" "}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
    doing the tough work of learning hard things!
  </span>
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>#2 Know when to write things down.</span>{" "}
  Note taking is an artform in itself. We all have our own weaknesses as
  learners and our note taking can fill some gaps in our natural abilities. The
  better you know yourself, the better notes you take. I personally have a
  learning journal for every topic that I am serious about (even some stupid
  topics). I write down definitions, thoughts, explanations and things that are
  done in specific ways "just because". I am not good with details and can't
  remember things that don't have a clear "why". It is just lovely to find good
  instructions for something that I have forgotten.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>#3 Went your frustrations.</span> There is
  something magical in telling your problems in an articulate and precise manner
  to someone else. When you do it, you will likely solve your own problem before
  the person you are talking to, has time to answer. Sometimes I have made
  google slide presentations with titles like "xyz doesn't f*cking work". It
  just works!
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>#4 It's ok to suck and be stupid.</span>{" "}
  Being shamelessly and openly stupid and bad is an underrated skill. We all try
  so hard to be the opposite. If we all could just let go of our egos' demands
  and other illusions, we would likely be better learners as well. Learning hard
  things is humbling and we should not make it harder by trying to "seem smart"
  etc.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>#5 Don't stop breathing.</span> Maybe it
  is just me, but I stop breathing if something is super frustrating. In those
  moments, I close my laptop or just take ride to sit on the beach.
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">Always be learning?</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  Sounds kinda terrible to me, but hey some of us are ultra-runners
</p>
<p className="text-b">
  I think it makes sense to learn hard things if you truly believe that they are
  worth it in the end. Not all hard things are worth learning, but the ones that
  are, always enable more freedom in your life.
