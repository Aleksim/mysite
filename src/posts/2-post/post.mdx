  Couple months ago I was listening to{" "}
  <span>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/csallen">Courtland Allen</a>
  </span>{" "}
  and{" "}
  <span>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/robwalling">Rob Walling</a>
  </span>{" "}
  discuss the importance of having an audience as a SaaS-founder. According to
  them, if a SaaS-founder has a large following, the odds of SaaS-success jump
  significantly.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>Reasons are pretty clear:</span> reach,
  network, validation and trust.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Indeed, trust is probably the most significant single factor in achieving
  Saas-success. However, it doesn't matter how trustworthy you are if nobody
  knows you.
</p>

<p className="text-b">That is why trust needs to be coupled with reach.</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">Going for the unconventional</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  So if an audience is a prerequisite for SaaS-success in 2021, how can you
  create an audience?
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Obviously, there are many ways to create an audience. But undoubtedly, not all
  are equally good.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I have never read a single article about how to create a personal brand and I
  wasn't about to do it now either. I just get itchy even thinking about it.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  What interested me was how could I use the principles of leverage, automation
  and cost-effectiveness{" "}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>to solve this problem.</span>
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  My first idea was indirect tactics: build an audience by building an
  acqusition channel:{" "}

<h2 className="blog-h2">
  The bet: software has become content and needs curation
</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  Whether it is a start-up or anything else, investing time or money into
  something is always a gamble. Because things do not always go as planned, no
  matter how hard you want something to happen.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Building own media is also a bet. It is a bet that what you are doing actually
  makes sense and creates value for other people.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  My bet is that software has become content and needs curation mechanisms just
  like any other type of content. I am betting also that I am the right person
  to create this type curation mechanism and it has not been done good enough
  yet.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  And I do not mean software in the general sense. I mean that different
  categories of software have turned into their own content types.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Thus, it is not enough to have generic software aggregation sites anymore.
  There needs to be specialized software aggregation sites.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I know marketing, growth hacking and software. I am the right person to create
  a platform for curating growth hacking software content. Perhaps I could use
  it as a vehicle to create an audience for myself simultaneously.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  My job is anyways to know all the latest tools and tactics. Maximum leverage,
  baby!
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">"IT IS TIME TO BUILD" - A16Z</h2>

<p className="text-b">It was time to start pushing buttons on my laptop.</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I chose Gatsby.js as the technology to create the first version of{" "}
  <span>
    <a href="https://www.growthhackertools.io">growthhackertools.io.</a>
  </span>{" "}
  Mainly because I know React and had been playing around with Gatsby before.
  Gatsby is good for building static-, fast loading- and SEO-friendly sites. All
  good qualities for the site that I was visioning.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I created the backend by connecting Airtable to my Gatsby application's
  GraphQL. In the beginning I would only need to fetch data so this solution was
  ok. In addition, I had heard a lot of praise for Airtable and wanted to get
  more familiar with it.
</p>

<p className="text-b">Everything worked pretty well.</p>

<p className="text-b">
  "oh shit, now I have to make the site look good somehow"
</p>

<p className="text-b">My biggest hurdle was the CSS/design.</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I am not a developer nor a designer. I am just mostly winging it, and I did it
  with the site design as well.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I looked some cool sites and drew a dark mode sketch in Photoshop.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Long story short, in about 2 weeks I had the minimum viable version of the
  service ready.
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">Ship it or die</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  It was time for my site to leave the comforts of http://localhost:8000/ and
  face the world.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I published the site in the usual places and got pretty nice traction. Over
  half of the visitors on my site came from outside Finland. With US and India,
  being the 2nd and 3rd biggest sources for visitors.
</p>

<p className="text-b">"Ok, there is some interest."</p>

<p className="text-b">
  "wait a second…I think…I HAVE ACHIEVED GLOBAL AUDIENCE"
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Good start/validation, but I knew that now I have to start thinking how can I
  make this site as valuable as possible as effectively- and as sustainably as
  possible.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I knew that this would be a long game, so I should prepare for it.
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">Automation, baby!</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  There are about a dozen places in the internet where developers publish their
  software. So actually it is not that hard to find "growth hacker tools".
  However, it takes time to go on these sites, everyday, and scroll down the
  published tool lists when there is so much software published every day.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  So, I set up over a dozen Scrapy spiders to turn many lists into a one list.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Thus, I automated the scraping of these sites and created one, daily updating,
  database of these tools.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Now my job is just to look at one list of published tools and then test and
  decide what fits the purpose of my site.
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">What's next?</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  Now, a month since the launch, I have still a lot of things to do and automate
  in the service and throughout the whole user journey.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  But I feel pretty confident that I am onto something. This will pay dividends
  for Grew's future SaaS-products.
</p>
