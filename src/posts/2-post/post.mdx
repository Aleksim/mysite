  Couple months ago I was listening to{" "}

  </span>{" "}
  and{" "}
  <span>

  </span>{" "}
  discuss the importance of having an audience as a SaaS-founder. Their
  discussion is part of a bigger debate on whether SaaS-founders should spend
  time on building an audience or not.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  The premise being, that if a SaaS-founder has a large following,
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
    {" "}
    it affects the probability of SaaS-success

  </span>{" "}
  : those are the things that an audience can provide.
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">Going for the unconventional</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  So if an audience is a prerequisite for SaaS-success in 2021, how could you
  create an audience?
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  There are many ways to create an audience. But undoubtedly, not all are
  equally good.
</p>

<p className="text-b">I think that there is a spectrum.</p>

<p className="text-b">
  On the one end, you have the approach of{" "}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
    "doing cool shit and telling about it"
  </span>{" "}
  (think of Elon Musk). And on the other end, you have the more conventional and
  intrusive{" "}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
    <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect"
    >
      “mere-exposure effect”
    </a>
  </span>{" "}
  .
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I get itchy even thinking about the conventional end of the spectrum. But I am
  not doing that cool stuff either (that I could build an audience based on it).
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  However, <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>I can do stuff</span>. So, I
  started thinking, could I apply the principles of automation, leverage and
  cost-effectiveness and{" "}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>build my way out of this dilemma?</span>
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  As I was reflecting this, I got the idea of an unconventional approach:{" "}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
    {" "}
    build an audience by building an acquisition channel:

<h2 className="blog-h2">
  The hypothesis: software has become content and needs curation
</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  Whether it is a start-up or anything else, investing time or money into
  something is always a gamble. Because things do not always go as planned, no
  matter how hard you want something to happen.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Building own media is also a bet. It is a bet that what you are doing actually
  makes sense and creates value for other people.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  My bet is that software has become content and needs curation mechanisms just
  like any other type of content.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  And I do not mean software in the general sense. I mean that different
  categories of software have turned into their own content types.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Thus, it is not enough to have generic software aggregation sites anymore.
  There needs to be specialized software aggregation sites.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I know marketing, growth hacking and software. So, I am probably the right
  person to create a platform for curating growth hacking software content.
  Perhaps I could use it as a vehicle to create an audience for myself
  simultaneously.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  My job is anyways to know all the latest tools and tactics so...{" "}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>maximum leverage, baby!</span>
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">"IT IS TIME TO BUILD" - A16Z</h2>

<p className="text-b">It was time to start pushing buttons on my laptop.</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I chose Gatsby.js as the technology to create the first version of{" "}
  <span>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.growthhackertools.io">
      growthhackertools.io.
    </a>
  </span>{" "}
  Mainly because I know React and had been playing around with Gatsby before.
  Gatsby is good for building static-, fast loading- and SEO-friendly sites. All
  good qualities for the site that I was visioning.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  First, I built a rest API with Express/Mongoose/Mongodb but then changed my
  mind and did it by connecting Airtable to my Gatsby application's GraphQL.
  Express + GraphQL seemed just too damn tricky and there was a Gatsby plugin
  for Airtable. I had heard a lot of praise for Airtable and this was a good
  chance to get more familiar with it. In the beginning, I would only need to
  fetch data so this solution was good enough.
</p>

<p className="text-b">Everything worked pretty well.</p>

<p className="text-b">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
    "oh shit, now I have to make the site look good somehow"
  </span>
</p>

<p className="text-b">My biggest hurdle was the CSS/design.</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I am not a developer nor a designer. I am just mostly winging it, and I did it
  with the site design as well.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I looked some cool sites and drew a dark mode sketch in Photoshop.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Long story short, in about 2 weeks I had the minimum viable version of the
  service ready.
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">Ship it or die</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  It was time for my site to leave the comforts of http://localhost:8000/ and
  face the world.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I published the site in the usual places and got pretty nice traction. Over
  half of the visitors on my site came from outside Finland. With US and India,
  being the 2nd and 3rd biggest sources for visitors.
</p>

<p className="text-b">"Ok, there is some interest."</p>

<p className="text-b">
  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
    "wait a second…I think…I HAVE ACHIEVED GLOBAL AUDIENCE for my site"
  </span>
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Pretty good start/validation, but I knew that now I have to start thinking how
  can I make this site as valuable as possible as effectively- and as
  sustainably as possible. It is the only way to make this "build an acquisition
  channel to build an audience"-approach to work.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  I knew that this would be a long game, so I started preparing for it using
  automation.
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">Automation, baby!</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  There are about a dozen places in the internet where developers publish their
  software. So actually it is not that hard to find "growth hacker tools".
  However, it takes time to go on these sites, everyday, and scroll down the
  published tool lists when there is so much software published every day.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  So, I set up over a dozen{" "}
  <span>
    <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html"
    >
      Scrapy spiders
    </a>
  </span>{" "}
  to turn many lists into a one list.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Thus, I automated the scraping of these sites and created one, daily updating,
  database of these tools.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  Now my job is just to look at one list of published tools and then test and
  decide what fits the purpose of my site.
</p>

<h2 className="blog-h2">What's next?</h2>

<p className="text-b">
  Now, a month since the launch, I have still a lot of things to do and automate
  in the service and throughout the whole user journey.
</p>

<p className="text-b">
  But I feel pretty confident that I am onto something. It is hard to say, how
  effective this "acquisition channel" will turn out to be, but I feel like
  investing more time into this at the moment.
</p>
